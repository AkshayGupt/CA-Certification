## CodeAsylums Test

Welcome to the CodeAsylums challenge !

### Criteria of Submissions

1. Setup the project locally and start the deployment.
2. Create a new folder with `username-FullName`.
3. Inside the folder, create different challenges folder you are attempting.
4. Raise the PR with `problem-Name` you have attempted.

#### Sample Workflow
Let's take a sample walk-through :

- Let's say you are attempting `test_fullstack`, `test_git`, `test_hosting` 
in `FullStackBatch` challenge, then your submissions folder directory should look like:

```
|---submissions
    |---username-FullName
        |---FullStackBatch
            |---test_fullstack
                |--solutionFile
            |---test_git
                |--solutionFile
            |---test_hosting
                |--solutionFile
```

Copy all the boilerplate and directory in the same way, and include your changes.

- Let's say you are attempting `MLBatch` then your submissions folder directory should look like:

```
|---submissions
    |---username-FullName
        |---MLBatch
            |---submissionFile
```

- Your PR should be have name: 
`fullstack-git-hosting`
