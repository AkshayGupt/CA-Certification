## CodeAsylums Test


### Criteria of Submissions

1. Setup the project locally and create a new branch of name `git-username`.
2. Create a new folder with `username-FullName`.
3. Inside the folder, create different challenges folder you are attempting.
4. Raise the PR with `problem-Name` you have attempted.


#### Sample Workflow
Let's take a sample walk-through :

- Let's say you are attempting `test_fullstack`, `test_git`, `test_hosting` challenge, then your submissions folder directory should look like :

```
|---submissions
    |---username-FullName
        |---test_fullstack
            |--solutionFile
        |---test_git
            |--solutionFile
        |---test_hosting
            |--solutionFile
```
Copy all the boilerplate and directory in the same way, and include your changes.

- Your PR should be from `git-username` branch of your alias to `master` branch of this repo. 

- PR name should be : 
`fullstack-git-hosting`
